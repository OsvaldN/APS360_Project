# Project Report
### 1.0 Introduction
The purpose of the project is to generate human faces that do not exist in the training set. Four models will be compared: An autoencoder (AE), a variational autoencoder (VAE), a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN), and a Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN). All models will be trained on a processed version of the publicly available LFW face dataset.

Our motivation is to learn about different face generation architectures since there are many applications related to face generation, which includes police sketching and data augmentation. We are also interested in assessing the effects of GANs on face generation. We would like to determine if GANs create sharper reconstructions and whether a VAE-GAN has more control over generation due to the restrictions on its latent space [1].

Considering the complexity of the task, machine learning is an appropriate tool for it; face generation is a task that does not lend itself to rules-based systems. Unlike traditional algorithms, machine learning algorithms can learn from large amounts of input data and create new data based on the structure of existing data [2].

The four models will be trained on the cleaned data (Figure 1). Quantitative assessment will be conducted by comparing MSE on the training set. However, the DC-GAN does not perform reconstruction so it will be assessed based on the quality of the generated faces. Ease of manipulating embeddings to generate new images will also be considered.

### 4.0 Architecture
#### 4.1 VAE
The Variational Autoencoder has 4 convolutional and 4 convolutional transpose layers. Batch normalization [4] is added at all convolutional layers, and the activation function has been changed to leaky ReLU [5] to aid training. The latent space is modeled as a standard Gaussian distribution. The similarity between the learned representation and a standard Gaussian is controlled by penalizing Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the two [6]. The weight of the KLD loss relative to the pixel-wise loss is treated as a hyperparameter. New samples can be generated by drawing form a standard Gaussian in the latent space.

#### 4.2 DC-GAN
The DC-GAN consists of a generator (Figure 7) and a discriminator (Figure 8). The generator is made up of five convolutional transpose layers and each layer is followed by a batch normalization and ReLU layer. Since the pixel intensities are normalized to -1 to 1 during data processing, a tanh layer is attached at the end of the generator to remain consistent with the range. Similarly, the discriminator has five convolutional layers and each layer is followed by a leaky ReLU and batch normalization layer. A sigmoid activation will be applied at the end to produce a probability.

#### 4.3 VAE-GAN
The same VAE architecture described above (section 4.1) is used for reconstruction. A 5 layer convolutional, batch-normed, leaky ReLU network with sigmoid output is used as the discriminator. Binary Cross-Entropy loss is used as the objective function for GAN training since the labels are binary values. The training cycle alternates training the discriminator and the generator. During discriminator training, the loss is calculated on equally sized batches of original images, their reconstructions, and standard Gaussian noise reconstructed from the decoder of the VAE. The generator is then trained with the discriminator loss on these same three groups; VAE MSE reconstruction loss and KLD loss are then backpropagated to further incentivize accurate reconstruction and a Gaussian distributed latent space. Currently, the VAE-GAN discriminator either tends to zero or perfect accuracy. Continued tuning in the near future is expected to solve this issue as was done with the DC-GAN.
